# App-Store
This repository is an appstore created for my IT 209 final project.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an acceptable
level of expertise with the fundamental procedural and object-oriented concepts and Graphical
User Interface (GUI) implementation techniques introduced and refined in lectures and labs
during the course of the semester.
